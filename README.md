# Accessible and Responsive tables

Prototype application to create accessible and responsive tables.

## Use case
This is suitable for all tables where row is more important than the column. This should not be used when columns are more important 

## How it works
On mobile it collapses each table row into its own section. This will appear with the column heading on the left, and the value on the right. The behaviour through a screenreader will be exactly the same as that of the desktop version.

## Steps to install
`npm install`  
`npm start`

| VoiceOver     | &#10004;|
| JAWS          | &#10004;|
| NVDA          | &#10004;|
