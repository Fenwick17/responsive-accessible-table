# Accessible and Responsive tables

Prototype application to create accessible and responsive tables.

## Use case
This is suitable for all tables where row is more important than the column.  

## How it works
On mobile it collapses each table row into its own section. The behaviour through a screenreader will be exactly the same as that of the desktop version.

## Steps to install
`npm install`  
`npm start`

| VoiceOver     | &#10004;|
| JAWS          | &#10004;|
| NVDA          | &#10004;|
